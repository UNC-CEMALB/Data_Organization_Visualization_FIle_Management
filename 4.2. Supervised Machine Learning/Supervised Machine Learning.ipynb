    "Machine learning is a field that has been around for decades, but has exploded in popularity and utility in recent years due to proliferation of big data. Through the building of models, machine learning has the ability to sift through and learn from large volumes of data and use that knowledge to solve problems. The challenges of big and high dimensional data as they pertain to environmental health and how machine learning can mitigate some of those challenges are discussed further in [Payton et. al](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1171175/full).\n",

    "## Training Module's Environmental Health Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This training module was specifically developed to answer the following environmental health questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we predict sex based on protein expression?\n",
    "2. Which proteins best predict sex? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, let's get an understanding for what machine learning is, how to train a model, and assess its model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a field of study in computer science that involves creating algorithms, which are a set of instructions that perform a specific task on a given dataset. These algorithms enable researchers to create models that can automatically analyze to new and unforeseen situations capable of improving automatically through experience and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning algorithm is designed to learn from examples and data, allowing it to adapt and improve over time. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that are too complex or difficult to be solved using traditional programming methods. **NOSA - I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEANT HERE BY TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING METHODS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through machine learning, scientists can:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create a model that adapts to new circumstances \n",
    "+ Detect patterns in large and complex datasets\n",
    "+ Evaluate the effectiveness of these patterns \n",
    "+ Make informed decisions about how to improve their models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the field of machine learning, there are two types that are most commonly used in environmental toxicology research: supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised machine learning** involves training a model using a labeled dataset, where each dependent or predictor variable is associated with an independent variable with a known outcome. This allows the model to learn how to predict the labeled outcome on data it hasn't \"seen\" before based on the patterns and relationships it previously identified in the data. For example, supervised machine learning has been used for cancer prediction and prognosis based on variables like tumor size, stage, and age ([Lynch et. al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386505617302368?via%3Dihub), [Asadi et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416093/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning includes: \n",
    "+ Classification: Using algorithms to classify a categorical outcome (ie. plant species, disease status, etc.)\n",
    "+ Regression: Using algorithms to predict a continuous outcome (ie. temperature, chemical concentration, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised machine learning**, on the other hand, involves using models to find patterns or associations between variables in dataset that lack a known or labeled outcome. For example, unsupervised machine learning has been used to find associations of co-expressed genes within various biological pathways ([Botía et. al](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0420-6), [Pagnuco et. al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754317300575?via%3Dihub)).\n",

    "([Langs et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6244522/))\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that there are also other types of machine learning, including semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning, which won't be discussed in these training modules. Overall, the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning is an important concept in machine learning, as it can inform the choice of algorithms and techniques used to analyze and make predictions from data.\n",

    "## Training Supervised Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised machine learning, algorithms need to be trained before they can be used to predict data. This involves selecting a smaller portion of data, known as training data, so that the model will learn how to predict the outcome as accurately as possible. The process of training an algorithm is essential for enabling it to learn and improve over time, allowing it to make more accurate predictions and better adapt to new and changing circumstances. Ultimately, the effectiveness of a machine learning model depends on the quality and relevance of its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine you're interested in predicting an animal's species (either a cat or a dog) based on a dataset that contains variables regarding weight, height, coat color, ear shape, etc. These data can be divided into a training set and a test set. The **training set** is a subset of the data that the model will learn from to make associations between the predictor variables (ie. height, weight etc.) and the outcome (ie. cat or dog). The **test set** is used used to evaluate what the model has learned from the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset will look something like this with 60% of the data in the training set and 40% of the data in the test set:\n",

    "The process of developing a model involves dividing the data into three main sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set:** a subset of the data that the model uses to learn from the data by identifying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation Set**: a subset of data that is used to evaluate the model's fit in an unbiased way by fine-tuning its parameters and optimizing its performance. This is akin to pop quizzes that help students improve their understanding and performance. **I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE 9/10 WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO CREATE THIS IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RELATED RESEARCH AND WE HAVEN'T CREATED CODE THAT INCLUDES THIS**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Set:** a subset of data that is used to evaluate the final model's fit based on the training and validation sets. This is the model's final exam, as it provides an objective assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the test set should only be used once, after the model has been trained using the training dataset. Using the test set multiple times during the development process can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the test data but poorly on new, unseen data. The ideal algorithm is generalizable or flexible enough to accurately predict unseen data. This is known as the bias-variance tradeoff. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last topic we should mention in this section is cross validation. If the dataset is based on this 60:40 split that we mentioned earlier, our model's accuracy will likely be influenced based upon *where* this 60:40 split occurs in the dataset. Cross validation is implemented to ensure that the model is exposed to more patterns in the dataset, which reduces bias improving prediction accuracy. \n",

    "+ **Accuracy:** is the ratio of correct predictions (TP + TN) to the total number of predictions (TP + TN + TN + FN) and is typically used to assess overall model performance. This metric is prone to skew for imbalanced data. For example, if the animal dataset had 11 cats and 74 dogs the data would be considered to be imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Sensitivity or Recall:** evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"positive\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true positives to total number of all true positives (TP + FN). \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Specificity:** evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"negative\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true negatives to total number of all true negatives (TN + FP). \n",

    "+  **Positive Predictive Value (PPV) or Precision:**  evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"positive\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true positives to total number of predicted positives (TP + FP).\n",
    "\n",
    "+  **Negative Predictive Value (PPV):**  evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"negative\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true negatives to total number of predicted positives (TN + FN).\n",
